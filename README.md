# Lidar Driver with DMA Support and Register-Based Control

This project is a register-based Lidar driver, developed without relying on any Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The driver provides low-level control over a Lidar sensor by directly manipulating hardware registers. Additionally, it incorporates DMA for efficient data transfer.

## Features

- **Register-based Interaction:** The driver communicates with the Lidar sensor by directly manipulating hardware registers, providing precise control over the sensor's functionalities.

- **DMA Data Transfer:** Utilizing Direct Memory Access, the driver enhances data transfer efficiency, reducing the CPU's involvement in the process and optimizing overall performance.

- **Platform Independence:** The code is designed to be platform-independent, making it adaptable to various embedded systems without the need for a specific IDE.

- **No External Dependencies:** The lightweight driver does not rely on external dependencies, simplifying integration into different projects.
